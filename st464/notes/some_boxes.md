### 2.1 Box 1

Date on cDNA microarrays.
Expression profiles for a specific gene sequence are recorded for $n$
individials diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders.
We could use clustering methods to form groups.
Groups might represent subtypes of the disorder. These are disjoint clusters.

## Lecture 8

### Box 1

The plot shows y_1 on the x axis and y_2 on the y axis.
The arrows are proprtional to the loadings.
The biplot is so-called because it shows both loadings and scores.
Notice the biplot is simply a rotation of the data.

### Next box

The first component is -(.53 murder + .58 assault + .27 urban pop + .54 rape) where variables are scaled.
This component is mostly a measure of the overall crime rate, (as UrbanPop gets a lower weight than other variables).
High crime states score low and low crime states score high.

### Box 1

This data set gives the performances of 34 men's decathlon at the Olympic Games (1988). There is also the scores, which are the ginal points scores of the competition.

### Box 2

The most obvious issue with this plot is case 34 is an outlier. He has the worst performance across the board.

This case ma also be affecting the results of the PCA, so we omit it.

### Box 3

Then classic mds finds z_1, z_2 to minimise

$ \sum*{i \neq j} \left( b*{ij} - <z_i , z_j >\right)^2 $

### Box 1

A student with an income of 20,000 and balance of 2,000 is not predicted to default...

### Another one

The ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve is a plot of the true positive rate versus the false positive rate for different threshholds.

Suppose $p=1$, i.e. we have 1 predictor.
Predictor values from the first class follow a Normal distribution with $\mu_1=0$ and $\sigma_1=1$, while those from the special ... $\mu=1.5$?
